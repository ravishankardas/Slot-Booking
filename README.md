Dependecies:  Flutter, JDK, Android studio

Follow the below steps to run the app:
1) In the android studio emulator i have used api 30 so if another api does not work download the api 30 
2) Download flutter from https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install (put it in the c drive if you are on windows)
3) After creating a flutter project in your favourite IDE setup firebase using this video https://youtu.be/CpyALC8Zpxo?t=183 (replace the things in this app as done in the video), in windows if you are having problems for the SHA fingerprints then look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6211919/errorkeytool-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-p
4) Launch the Emulator and run the flutter app on it, for the first time it may take a while to install (I have tested the app only on android, so on IOS it may not work)
